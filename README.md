# Monty-Hall-Problem

Here I have recreated the famous Monty Hall Problem as a simple project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  It is basically an emulation of the game, with three doors and a 'Hide Prize' button.  In a browser console the "hidden object" can be seen as soon as you "hide it", represented by an array of 3 doors, where 1 = prize (car), and 0 = no prize (goat).
